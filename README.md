# 🧟 From the Dead — Pixel Art Jam Submission

This is my completed entry for the **Pixel Art Jam**, themed **“From the Dead.”**  
A simple, atmospheric game with a working **radar mechanic**, made in **Godot 4**. The goal was to make something functional, clean, and finished within the jam period.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

You play a soul risen from the dead, guided only by a mysterious radar. No complex combat, no flashy mechanics — just a minimalist journey through a silent world with a pulse.

### Core Features:
- ⚙️ **Radar mechanic** to locate hidden or off-screen entities
- 🎮 Simple back-fourth movement
- 📡 Visual feedback for radar range/direction
- 🔁 A complete gameplay loop

## 🎨 Tools Used

- **Engine**: Godot 4.x  
- **Art**: Custom pixel art  
- **Audio**: [add if you used any sounds/music]  
- **Time Limit**: [e.g., 7 days, 48 hours]

## 🚧 Notes

This wasn’t the flashiest game of the jam — and that’s okay.  
It was stable, complete, and delivered what it aimed for. A milestone in finishing what I start, and proof that I can turn ideas into shippable games.
